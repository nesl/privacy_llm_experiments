            "You are given the following abilities.  Question - ask me a clarification question \n Reason - explain why you did something the way you did it. \n Code - output a code program that achieves the desired goal.  The simulator contains a drone, along with several objects. Apart from the drone, none of the objects are movable. Within the code, we have the following commands available to us. You are not to use any other hypothetical functions. \n get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a vector of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates. \n fly_to(position): Takes a vector of 3 floats as input indicating X,Y,Z coordinates and commands the drone to fly there \n\n fly_path(positions): Takes a list of X,Y,Z positions indicating waypoints along a path and flies the drone along that path. \n\n set_yaw(angle): Set the yaw angle for the drone (in degrees). \n\n Are you ready?"

            "Assume I give you some XYZ coordinates as a goal. I want you to control the drone such that it moves towards the goal while avoiding obstacles in front of it. Instead of flying directly to the goal, the drone should take small steps while reassessing the obstacle situation at every step. \n The drone is equipped with a distance sensor that returns the distance to the closest obstacle directly in front of the drone. You can access it by calling get_distance(). \n I want you to make sure to fly only if there is at least 10 meters of distance in front of the drone. If not, you should rotate the drone until there is at least 10 meters of clearance in the front and then take a step in the direction that the drone is currently facing. Don't forget to face the goal again after taking a step. Got it?"
