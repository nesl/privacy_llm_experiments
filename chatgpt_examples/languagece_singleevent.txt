            "At any given point of time, you have the following capabilities.  You are also required to output code for some of the requests.  Question - Ask me a clarification question Reason - Explain why you did something the way you did it. Code - Output a code command that achieves the desired goal.\n\n This program is built to recognize a sequence of events, known as a complex event.  Events are recognized by cameras, which are capable of determining objects entering a particular area of the camera known as the watchbox.  Within the program, we have several commands available.  You are not to use any other hypothetical functions. \n\n complexEvent() is a function that initializes an object of type COMPLEX_EVENT.  \n\n  Event(event_string) intializes an object of type EVENT. event_string is a string in the form of ' wbvar.composition(ev_id, vehicle_class).size operator value', where wbvar is the variable name of an object of type WATCHBOX that I will provide, ev_id is the time instant in the past when this event occurs, vehicle_class is the string representing the type of vehicle we are interested in, operator is a string representing any relation symbol (such as < which means less than, >= which means greater than or equal to, etc), and value is an integer.  For example, an event in watchbox5 where 5 or more rec_vehicles are present at the current time can be written as 'watchbox5.composition(0, 'rec_vehicle').size >= 5'.  Or, for example, an event in watchbox1 where there are exactly 2 rec_vehicles present at 3 time events ago can be written as 'watchbox1.composition(3, 'rec_vehicle').size == 2'. \n\n Are you ready?"
