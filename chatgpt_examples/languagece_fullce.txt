            "At any given point of time, you have the following capabilities.  You are also required to output code for some of the requests.  Question - Ask me a clarification question Reason - Explain why you did something the way you did it. Code - Output a code command that achieves the desired goal.\n\n This program is built to recognize a sequence of events, known as a complex event.  Events are recognized by cameras, which are capable of determining objects entering a particular area of the camera known as the watchbox.  Within the program, we have several commands available.  You are not to use any other hypothetical functions. \n\n complexEvent() is a function that initializes an object of type COMPLEX_EVENT.  \n\n  Event(event_string) intializes an object of type EVENT. event_string is a string in the form of ' wbvar.composition(ev_id, vehicle_class).size operator value', where wbvar is the variable name of an object of type WATCHBOX that I will provide, ev_id is the time instant in the past when this event occurs, vehicle_class is the string representing the type of vehicle we are interested in, operator is a string representing any relation symbol (such as < which means less than, >= which means greater than or equal to, etc), and value is an integer.  For example, an event in watchbox5 where 5 or more rec_vehicles are present at the current time can be written as 'watchbox5.composition(0, 'rec_vehicle').size >= 5'.  Or, for example, an event in watchbox1 where there are exactly 2 rec_vehicles present at 3 time instants ago can be written as 'watchbox1.composition(3, 'rec_vehicle').size == 2'.  event_string may also be written as the combination of two event_string strings, in the form of event_string = 'event_string rel event_string', where rel is a logical operator using either of ['and', 'or'].  For example, an event in which watchbox5 has 2 rec_vehicles at the current time instant and watchbox3 has fewer than 3 rec_vehicles at the previous time instant can be written as 'watchbox5.composition(0, 'rec_vehicle').size == 2 and watchbox3.composition(1, 'rec_vehicle').size < 3'\n\n aa.addEventSequence(event_sequence, no_enforce_sequence) adds a sequence of events to a COMPLEX_EVENT object named aa.  event_sequence is a list of either op(event_name, event_name) or event_name.  event_name is the name of the variable for an EVENT object.  no_enforce_sequence takes a boolean value where it is false if the ordering matters, and true if otherwise.  op can take several values: AND() requires that the event occurrences overlap in time, while OR() requires either event occurrences to happen.  Each element of the list occurs after the next.  For example, if we have a COMPLEX_EVENT object named ce1, and we want to detect if event1 and event2 overlap in time, followed by event3, then the function call would look like ce1.addEventSequence([AND(event1, event2), event3], False).  Or, for example, if we have a COMPLEX_EVENT object named ce5, and we want to detect if either event2 or event3 occur, and event 4 may also occur at any time, and ordering does not matter, then the function call would look like ce5.addEventSequence([OR(event2, event3), event4], True) .  Importantly, the AND and OR functions may only be used inside of the addEventSequence function.  \n Are you ready?"

WATCHBOX 'br2' is observing the west side of the bridge.  \n\nCreate a COMPLEX EVENT for the following example: two rec vehicles are parked in both the east and west side of the bridge, and then later the rec_vehicles on the west side leave the bridge area.  \n\nMake sure that the content of event_string is contained with the Event() function.  \n\n  Got it?"

            "I will provide 5 WATCHBOX objects in this scenario. WATCHBOX 'high1' is observing a highway.  WATCHBOX 'bridge1' is observing the entirety of a bridge.  WATCHBOX 'bridge_east' and WATCHBOX 'bridge_west' is observing the east and west sides of the same bridge, respectively.  WATCHBOX 'road' is observing the middle of a small road.   \n\nCreate a COMPLEX EVENT for the following example: four rec_vehicles are present on the highway.  Then, later those same rec_vehicles enter at the bridge.  In both cases, there were not 4 vehicles previously.  Then later, those same 4 rec_vehicles split into two rec_vehicles in both the east and west side of the bridge, and there are more than 4 tanks in the middle of the small road - make sure that this event overlaps in time with the previous event.  Finally, 2 rec_vehicles leave the west side of the bridge.  \n\n Make sure that the content of the event_string is contained with the Event() function.  Also, make sure that when vehicles leave or enter an area, they are described in both a current and previous time.  For example, when 2 rec_vehicles leave WATCHBOX object br1, it can be described as 'br1.composition(0, 'rec_vehicle').size == 0 and br1.composition(1, 'rec_vehicle).size != 0.  Also, please do not generate duplicate events.  Finally, you may only call addEventSequence once you have defined all the events. \n\n  Got it?"
