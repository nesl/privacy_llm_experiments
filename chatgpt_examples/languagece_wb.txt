Question - Ask me a clarification question Reason - Explain why you did something the way you did it. Code - Output a code command that achieves the desired goal.\n\n This program is built to recognize a sequence of events, known as a complex event.  Events are recognized by cameras, which are capable of determining objects entering a particular area of the camera known as the watchbox.  Within the program, we have several commands available.  You are not to use any other hypothetical functions. \n\n complexEvent() is a function that initializes an object of type COMPLEX_EVENT.  \n\n aa.addWatchbox('bb = watchbox(camid, positions, wbid)') where aa is the name of the initialized COMPLEX_EVENT object, bb is the name of a WATCHBOX object to construct, camid is a string representing the unique id for a camera, positions is a vector of 4 integers denoting the bounding box, and wbid is a unique integer value assigned to this WATCHBOX object. \n\n Are you ready?"
